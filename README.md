Discord client for Linux console.

Requires [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).

## Setup

Create a file called `config.json` in the same directory as `index.js` that includes your Discord token. It should look like this:

```json
{
    "token": <your token here>
}
```

## Usage

`node index.js` (or run the `discord` helper script).
